everyone
considered
him
the
coward
of
the
county
he'd
never
stood
one
single
time
to
prove
the
county
wrong
his
mama
named
him
tommy
but
folks
just
called
him
yellow
but
something
always
told
me
they
were
reading
tommy
wrong
he
was
only
ten
years
old
when
his
daddy
died
in
prison
i
looked
after
tommy
'cause
he
was
my
brother
son
i
still
recall
the
final
words
my
brother
said
to
tommy
son
my
life
is
over
but
yours
has
just
begun
promise
me
son
not
to
do
the
things
i've
done
walk
away
from
trouble
if
you
can
now
it
won't
mean
you're
weak
if
you
turn
the
other
cheek
i
hope
you're
old
enough
to
understand
son
you
don't
have
to
fight
to
be
a
man
there
someone
for
everyone
and
tommy
love
was
becky
in
her
arms
he
didn't
have
to
prove
he
was
a
man
one
day
while
he
was
working
the
gatlin
boys
came
calling
they
took
turns
at
becky
an'
there
was
three
of
them
tommy
opened
up
the
door
and
saw
becky
crying
the
torn
dress
the
shattered
look
was
more
than
he
could
stand
he
reached
above
the
fireplace
and
took
down
his
daddy
picture
as
his
tears
fell
on
his
daddy
face
he
heard
these
words
again
promise
me
son
not
to
do
the
things
i've
done
walk
away
from
trouble
if
you
can
now
it
won't
mean
you're
weak
if
you
turn
the
other
cheek
i
hope
you're
old
enough
to
understand
son
you
don't
have
to
fight
to
be
a
man
the
gatlin
boys
just
laughed
at
him
when
he
walked
into
the
bar
room
one
of
them
got
up
and
met
him
half
way
cross
the
floor
when
tommy
turned
around
they
said
hey
look
old
yellow
leaving
but
you
could've
heard
a
pin
drop
when
tommy
stopped
and
locked
the
door
twenty
years
of
crawling
was
bottled
up
inside
him
he
wasn't
holding
nothing
back
he
let
'em
have
it
all
when
tommy
left
the
bar
room
not
a
gatlin
boy
was
standing
he
said
this
one
for
becky
as
he
watched
the
last
one
fall
and
i
heard
him
say
i
promised
you
dad
not
to
do
the
things
you've
done
i
walk
away
from
trouble
when
i
can
now
please
don't
think
i'm
weak
i
didn't
turn
the
other
cheek
and
papa
i
should
hope
you
understand
sometimes
you
gotta
fight
when
you're
a
man
everyone
considered
him
the
coward
of
the
county
