i
got
my
driver's
license
last
week
just
like
we
always
talked
about
'cause
you
were
so
excited
for
me
to
finally
drive
up
to
your
house
but
today
i
drove
through
the
suburbs
crying
'cause
you
weren't
around
and
you
probably
with
that
blonde
girl
who
always
made
me
doubt
she's
so
much
older
than
me
she's
everything
i'm
insecure
about
yeah
today
i
drove
through
the
suburbs
'cause
how
could
i
ever
love
someone
else
and
i
know
we
weren't
perfect
but
i
never
felt
this
way
for
no
one
and
i
just
can't
imagine
how
you
could
be
so
okay
now
that
i'm
gone
guess
you
didn't
mean
what
you
wrote
in
that
song
about
me
'cause
you
said
forever
now
i
drive
alone
past
your
street
and
all
my
friends
are
tired
of
hearing
how
much
i
miss
you
but
i
kinda
feel
sorry
for
them
'cause
they'll
never
know
you
the
way
that
i
do
yeah
today
i
drove
through
the
suburbs
and
pictured
i
was
driving
home
to
you
and
i
know
we
weren't
perfect
but
i
never
felt
this
way
for
no
one
oh
and
i
just
can't
imagine
how
you
could
be
so
okay
now
that
i'm
gone
i
guess
you
didn't
mean
what
you
wrote
in
that
song
about
me
'cause
you
said
forever
now
i
drive
alone
past
your
street
red
lights
stop
signs
i
still
see
your
face
in
the
white
cars
front
yards
can't
drive
past
the
places
we
used
to
go
to
'cause
i
still
fweeein'
love
you
babe
ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
sidewalks
we
crossed
i
still
hear
your
voice
in
the
traffic
we
laughing
over
all
the
noise
god
i'm
so
blue
know
we
through
but
i
still
fweeein'
love
you
babe
ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
i
know
we
weren't
perfect
but
i
never
felt
this
way
for
no
one
and
i
just
can't
imagine
how
you
could
be
so
okay
now
